# Rug Pull Index Handbook

The RPI Handbook is a method to document processes within the Rug Pull Index
organization. Its purpose is to allow contributors to quickly get up to speed
with how things are done around here. Other companies have handbooks too.
Notable examples are Valve (Steam) and GitLab.

## What It Means To Work For The Public Good

Rug Pull Index has repeatedly received funds from the [oceanDAO](https://oceanprotocol.com). In all our proposals, our main rethoric was along the following lines: "We're creating value for the Ocean Protocol and hence we're allowing ourselves to regularly raise funds from the DAO."

Living this rethoric yields some practical requirements that influences our work directly. An example:

We try to reduce information asymmetry and we strive to discuss all matters not subject to exposing sensitive information (e.g. PII, etc.)) in public channels to allow everyone to become part of a conversation.

We do so as we believe in a swarm intelligence. We acknowledge that innovation stems from an organic discovery process fueled through the collective and not through the articifial production of a or some individuums.

We believe that continuity, originality and commitment are the drivers of value and innocation.

We have an incomplete but ripening set of values that we regularly reflect our actions upon. We value authenticity, responsibility and fairness. They shall guide our work. 

## How to get an offer approved to start working on RPI

To start getting paid for your work on RPI you will need to create a one page proposal outlining the work you intend to do, the amount of time it will take you and your hourly rate in USD. 

All work will be paid retroactively in USDC either in stages, upon partial completion of your project, or in full upon completion.

### Expenses

If you intend to incur outside expenditure for your project that you wish to be reimbursed for, this will need to be estimated and the amount approved in advance. A receipt for expenditure will need to be provided in order to receive reimbursements. 

### Deciding what should be in your proposal

In some instances you will have clear deliverables as set by the RPI team (e.g. tasks or chunks of work that the RPI team have already provided an outline for). When this is the case, your proposal should outline how you intend to achieve these outcomes and the amount of time you need to complete them. 

In other instances you will be proposing something new. For these proposals we recommend discussing your ideas and/or getting feedback from the RPI team on Discord first. This will help to ensure your intentions and the needs of the RPI project are aligned. 

### Writing Your Proposal

Your proposal should be a short, concise (roughly 1 page) summary of the work you intend to do and the impact &/or reasons why the work you are proposing will be valuable to RPI.

* Try to keep proposals targeted and specific. Upon successful completion of one proposal you can always submit a second.
* Try to break down larger chunks of work into smaller, manageable pieces which add value. 
* Every proposal, once complete, should have added value to RPI in some way.
* If the proposal does not add enough value relative to the cost it will not be funded. This is to ensure we have a positive ROI for all proposals approved.
* Proposals with a large scope and open ended deliverables are unlikely to be funded.

### Estimating your time

Once you have broken down your deliverables into appropriately sized chunks, and clearly summarised the work &/or value you intend to provide it should be relatively easy to estimate how much time you will need to complete the task. 

Add an estimate to each task and calculate the overall time estimate. This, along with your hourly rate will be used to calculate the total cost of your proposal. This total cost and your proposed deliverables will need to be approved before you start working. 

Once approved, this amount (total cost) will be set aside for you to complete your deliverables. 

### Keeping up to date with delivery

Once you have received approval for your project and begin working, it’s important to keep track of the time you spend. If at any stage it’s looking like you will need to adjust your estimates, or change direction from the original plan, please check in with the team for further approvals before going ahead and committing extra hours.

Any additional hours/work you do that wasn’t approved will not automatically be funded. We know that things change as you get deeper into a project and sometimes other factors outside your control will impact your deliverables. That’s ok, but what is important is that you communicate these changes clearly with the team as and when they arise. 

### Getting Paid

If your proposal has been approved, you have completed your tasks to the agreed standard and you now wish to get paid, please create an invoice using [Request](https://invoicing.request.network/) and make sure to address it to tim@daubenschuetz.de.

## How we calculate the amount of funds requested on Ocean DAO proposals

### Methodology to Request Funds in the OCEANDAO

In the OCEANDAO, funds have to be requested in
[OCEAN](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol). At RPI, we have a
specific methodology for requesting funds. We prioritize stability and
risk-reduction over potential gains in the market. This means that we have an
interest in converting non-stable assets (e.g.  OCEAN) into fiat-stable assets
(e.g. USDC). We do this, as we'd like to guarantee contributor's priorly
confirmed budgets.

Calculating the budget for a new OCEANDAO round is done as follows:

- For all contributors, we check if they've submitted a new offer that quotes a
  total budget in OCEAN. If they have, we add it to our round's budget.
- In case a contributor hasn't submitted a separate offer but still requests
  funds in a round, we take the contributor's average monthly salary in OCEAN
  and add it to the rounds budget (pro tip: you can compute a contributor's
  average monthly salary by looking into the latest cash-basis accounting
  statement).
- For all contributors that have fiat expenses (e.g. running a web server), we
  ask them to declare them in OCEAN and we then add them to the round's budget.
- Finally, we for all previous rounds were RPI had declare a "funds required"
  field in the OCEANDAO proposal, we find an average error value between what
  was original required in a stable currency and what ended up being exchanged
  after winning the proposal (see example below).

Note that all quotes from all contributors must use a mutually agreed upon
exchange rate between the non-stable asset and the stable asset (e.g. we take
the OCEAN/USDC price 3 days before the proposal deadline).

#### Example Calculation

Assume the following:

- It's OCEANDAO round 1337 (short: R1337).
- Contributor Tim isn't submitting a separate offer but is requesting his
  average monthly salary for R1337.
- Contributor Scott is submitting an offer and requests 1800 USD total budget.
- Contributor Tim submits 200 EUR in expenses (server cost).
- The latest [cash-basis accounting is from
  2021-07-21](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rYoYKCt0Ri7aXp3pZnyRzHPw2C3JniO0/view?usp=sharing).

Here's what the person creating the budget now has to do:

1. Go to a website like
   [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol) and determine
   a fixed exchange rate for OCEAN/EUR and OCEAN/USD. In our case, for today
   2021-07-31 OCEAN/EUR = 0.40 and OCEAN/USD = 0.48.
2. Then for all contributors' quotes, ask them to resubmit them in OCEAN given
   the fixed exchange rates in OCEAN/EUR and OCEAN/USD.

Executing steps (1) and (2), we get the following list

|position|OCEAN value|EUR value|USD value|
|---|---|---|---|
|Salary Scott|3750|-|1800|
|Expenses Tim|500|-|200|

But then, for Tim we also need to check his average monthly salary. So we take
all positions from the expenses table (EUR) of the cash-basis-accounting
document : 6362.95+9472.47+8940.10+10133.22=34908.74 and divide it by the
number of months (six): 34908.74/6 = 5818.12 EUR. We then convert this value to
OCEAN using our fixed exchange rate. 5818.12 EUR/0.4 OCEAN/EUR = 14545.3 OCEAN.
Our new table now looks as follows:

|position|OCEAN value|EUR value|USD value|
|---|---|---|---|
|Salary Scott|1042|-|500|
|Expenses Tim|500|-|200|
|Salary Tim|14545.3|5818.12|-|

Finally, we want to compute an error value for all previous proposals. For
that, we have to know all previous proposal's targeted stable value as well as
their OCEAN value. For the "EUR value swapped", we can again look into the
cash-basis-accounting statement.

|round|EUR value|OCEAN value requested|USD value swapped|swap date|EUR/USD at swap date|EUR value swapped|EUR error|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|[R6](https://port.oceanprotocol.com/t/rugpullindex-com-proposal-r6/650)|7000|13000|7546.43|2021-06-09|1.22|6185.59|814.41|
|[R7](https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-7/64)|8512|22400|8390.49|2021-07-22|1.18|7110.58|1401.42|

Hence, the average stable value that occurs between the time a proposal is
submitted to the time it has been won and converted to a stable currency is
currently: (814.41 EUR+1401.42 EUR)/2=1107.91 EUR.

To conclude our budget, we add it in OCEAN as well and sum up the OCEAN column.

|position|OCEAN value|EUR value|USD value|
|---|---|---|---|
|Salary Scott|1042|-|500|
|Expenses Tim|500|-|200|
|Salary Tim|14545.3|5818.12|-|
|Average error|2769.77|1107.91|-|
|**SUM**|18856.07|7542.42|-|

We hence publish the total value, along with the OCEAN/EUR and OCEAN/USD
exchange rate in the proposal.
